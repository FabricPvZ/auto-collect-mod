// game jar and the libraries the online version package's JSON next to it names (the real Fabric
// Loader, Mixin, ASM, SLF4J/Log4j and LWJGL with its natives), on the compile, test and launch class
// paths - plus the runClient task, the end-to-end test conventions and the publication of the mod jar
// under mavenLocal coordinates. It supplies nothing else: everything this mod uses besides the game
// is declared below, with the version this build was made with.
//
// The version is the plugin's own (every artifact of this workspace is released under its own
// version); the plugin resolves from the Gradle Plugin Portal, with mavenLocal after it as the
